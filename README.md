# wordlose
a wordle game where you can't win

## how does it work?
to ensure that you never win a game of wordle, an AI model chooses a random word which is no longer used in modern english or hardly anyone knows the word.

## why did you make it?
because i wanted to. i was feeling bored so, i decided to make this.

## did you use AI to make it?
yeah :( i don't really know alot of next.js so, i had to use AI to get some help.
